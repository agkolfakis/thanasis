### phpMyAdmin
   We have downloaded phpmyadmin and extracted inside C:\Apache24\htdocs.
   We must configure php.ini file inside C:\PHP in order to work.
   Specifically, we uncomment : extension=php_mbstring.dll and extension=php_mysqli.dll
   We had also had to change inside C:\Apache24\conf the httpd.conf file in order for apache to recognize php files as start pages.
   Specifically, we changed the directory index from index.html to index.php.
   phpMyAdmin is to administer mysql databases. Therefore, first start mysql server
   Start apache, and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. Enter your username and password for mysql server and you are in.

   Additionally, we have created a new user for the wordpress database :  username: wordpress , password:12345

### Wordpress and Apache   ( WATCH PAGES AND VIDEOS INSIDE CHROME BOOKMARKS "WORDPRESS")

    Notice: Microsoft WebMatrix and Wordpress is configured to work with MySQL Server 5.7 with the GUI.
            Apache and Wordpress is configured to work with MySQL Server 5.7 with the command line.


   Download wordpress from www.wordpress.org  AND NOT www.wordpress.com
   Extract it inside C:\Apache24\htdocs.
   We must configure the mysql server before installing wordpress.
   Start MySQL Server from command prompt.
   Start Apache, and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin
   I have created a new database with name : wordpress
   I have also created a new user (username:wordpress, password:12345) with all privileges regarging wordpress database.
   We are ready. Navigate to : http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php
   Follow the instructions and save the password for wordpress. You will need it.
   After installation you can start wordpress, by navigating to : http://localhost/wordpress. BE CAREFUL, START "MYSQL SERVER" FIRST . 

   Notice: If you want to add plugins manually, download them and extract them to : C:\Apache24\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\plugins
   Notice: THE IMPERATIVE PLUGINS ARE ALREADY INSTALLED IN WEBMATRIX SITES(wordpress1). WATCH THE VIDEOS IN WORDPRESS BOOKMARKS FOLDER FOR DETAILS.
           
           For example, we have used WP-MAIL-SMTP plugin in order for the visitors of my page to send me emails using gmail smtp.
           @@ ALTERNATIVELY. We can use sendmail inside C:\sendmail, which has all the configurations in sendmail.ini file to connect and send mails using gmail.
                             Then inside php.ini of C:\PHP, we configure  that php mail function should use sendmail.exe file by declaring :sendmail_path = C:\sendmail\sendmail.exe
                             Moreover, we had to change the compatibility of sendmail.exe file. 
                             1) Right click on sendmail.exe
                             2) properties
                             3) compatibility
                             4) change setting for all user
                             5) tick on comptatibility mode for all users using WINDOWS XP SERVICE PACK 3.

                             Then if we navigate to :http://localhost/mail.php , i have a file that uses mail function of php to send mails.
                             Wordpress is using mail function of php in order to send mails, therefore in the contact form of mysite in wordpress inside apache , we make use of it.
     
  Notice: In Apache i have configured the httpd.conf file to use ssl certificate (expose ssl.dll file and point to ca.key and ca.crt), following the instructions in my written notes.
          I have created a self-signed certificate and i have put it ( the ca.key and ca.crt) inside  C:\apache24\conf\ssl folder
          I have downloaded wordpress https plugin and configure that the checkout page and every login to be served with ssl.

### EXPORTING THE DATABASE FROM APACHE SERVER TO agolf.atwebpages.com    ( WATCH PAGES AND VIDEOS INSIDE CHROME BOOKMARKS "WORDPRESS")
    FINALLY I HAVE TRANSFERED ALL THE SITE TO : athanasiosgkolfakis.com  THE FOLLOWING ARE APPLICABLE TO THIS SITE ALSO.

  1) Use this for exporting the database "wordpress" used in apache server or phpmyadmin(i have tried it but exports a php file and not an sql):

mysqldump -h host_name -u username -p databasename > filename.sql    //e.g. mysqldump -u wordpress -p 12345 wordpress > filename.slq (from the bin folder on a command line)


    Use this for import OR USE PHPMYADMIN:

mysql -u username -p databasename < filename.sql

  
  2) I have created a new account in www.leadhoster.com with credentials :  username :2156406  password: 265f2d80 and email: agolfakis@yahoo.com
     The new page is : agolf.atwebpages.com
     
     I have created a new database there:  
     database name: 2156406_agolf
     database user: 2156406_agolf
     user password: 265f2d80
     database HOST : fdb15.leadhoster.com
     THESE MUST BE PUT INSIDE wp-config.php file
    
  2a) I have also created an email account: admin@athanasiosgkolfakis.com  password: 265f2d80
      This is what my customers see when they accept an email from me. However, all other jobs inside wordpress admin site are using agolfakis@gmail.com

  3) DO NOT INSTALL WORDPRESS IN THE NEW SITE

  4) Just transfer the files from apache server , from C:\apache24\htdocs\wordpress (all inside the wordpress) using FILEZILLA to agolf.atwebpages.com
     Inside the FILEZILLA enter the following as declared in the FTP Manager of www.leadhoster.com:
     FTP Host : agolf.atwebpages.com
     Username:  2156406_agolf
     Password: 265f2d80
     Connect, open the agolf.atwebpages.com folder in the right panel and drag and drop all the files from the local computer. (ALL OF THEM AND NOT ONE BY ONE)
   
  5) This is the time you have to change the wp-config.php file with the data from step 2.

  6) Inside the www.leadhoster.com, open the Database Manager, press on the database and open with phpmyadmin.
     Now you have to import the sql file you have created in step 1.
     Press on the database and from the right menu select import. Locate and upload the sql file which you created earlier.
     After that you can search on the tables of the database for "localhost/wordpress" and replace with "agolf.leadhoster.com"

  7) I had to delete the https plugin from the files in the site, otherwise it was redirecting me to https:// with an error page.
     Try navigate to http://agolf.leadhoster.com/wp-admin or login.php and use the credentials you used to have in the localhost apache server.
     username: wordpress
     password:ceMYSvFkiY76lJ$%Q&
